## Developer
___
I graduated in Computer Engineering from the University of La Laguna (Tenerife - Spain). I have focused my training in Information Technology, which has provided to me knowledge related with web and mobile development, security and data processing.

I consider myself a hard worker person, active and dynamic. Be aware of the goals of the project I work for is important for me. It is helpful for me to be focused and work hard. I think the most important for a developer is learning because this business is continuously advancing and it is the best way to get the best results, be useful, and innovate. I love work as part of a team, learn and contribute, study, and negotiate alternatives.

My favorites languages are Android and Ruby, but also I have worked with php, java and react. Currently, I'm studying angular and it seems very interesting. I also have experience with other software development tools like git, docker, jira, swagger, etc. And talking about languages, I have experience with the English language, too!

If I have time during the sprint, I use my time in the development and integration of tests to get a robust application. I usually focus on unit tests and user interfaces like instrumented tests (Android) or Selenium (web).
