## TempBuddy
My main task is to develop  and maintain the [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tempbuddy.tempbuddy) of TempBuddy and the rest of investing clients.

## ABC4EU
  I developed an Android application for devices used by border guards to control travelers and verify their electronic documents and their status in the country. The application can read documents (MRZ) and chip reading (RFID) as well as biometric readings (fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.). To do this I integrated the SDK provided by the company [Coppernic](https://www.coppernic.fr/). The app is not for public use but you can [see videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp4Cfh2A7q5EEa8yK7xQrJw) for demonstration on Youtube.
