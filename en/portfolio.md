Here you could find some of the projects where I have worked on and contributed to.

## TempBuddy

My main task was the management of TempBuddy and client apps (see [TempBuddy Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tempbuddy.tempbuddy) or [TempBuddy iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/tempbuddy/id905008100) for details), I also participated in the development and maintenance of the [web portal](https://eu.tempbuddy.com/) as fullstack and QA member.

## ABC4EU

I developed an Android application for devices used by border guards to check travellers and verify their electronic documents and their status in the country. The application can read documents (MRZ) and chips (RFID) as well as biometric data (fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.).In order to do this, I integrated the SDK provided by the company [Coppernic](https://www.coppernic.fr/). The app is not for public use but you can [see videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp4Cfh2A7q5EEa8yK7xQrJw) demonstration videos on Youtube.
